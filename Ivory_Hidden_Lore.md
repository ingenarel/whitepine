# Hidden Lore in Latest Announcements From Ivory

**TODO**: find a better name for this.

## Current Sources of Information

- The YouTube video, URL discovered via letters provided in images posted to the announcements: [1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qw99S3e-ak)
- The images posted in the announcements channel. 
  - Data sources linked through those, e.g., Twitter accounts, Mediafire, etc.
  - **TODO**: provide a list of all the images.

## Shit We Already Looked at

**TODO**: Fill out this section

## Things That Haven't Been Tried

**TODO**: Fill out this section

## Currently Known Information

Images seem to get progressively lighter (8 and after break this trend). Increasing the exposure makes it easier to see the hidden characters (reported: setting it to 3 is sufficient)

The letters on the signs are as follows:

```
ywcwy
oohio
unalu
 tnl
  g
  e
```

Reading the text veritically provides the following:

> you wont change will you

The other letters give a YouTube link to [1 by ivory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qw99S3e-ak) (skifli may or may not have bruteforced 4 days early though lol).

### 4.mp4 @16:00

Only one that is not an image. The video was encoded at **2024-08-04 14:54:31 UTC**.

**TODO**: what other metadata does this video have?

### 6.png @18:55

There is a faint `@` symbol before the newspaper name, and [a Twitter account](https://x.com/TheEmbertonWire) with the same tag was found that is recently created and posted a higher resolution version of the article, without the background stuff.

The Twitter account says **unbiased, fair, and logical news organization.** (in the description), and is located in **Emberton, Hale**. This is a real place in England.

The only typos in the article are `expidetion presteige` which have an e in the wrong spot.

### 8.png @16:07

The character for the secret message is not on a sign, presumably because the POV is too far away to be able to read a sign. It is in the Minecraft font though.

### 9.png @18:27

Only post with accompanying text - **tomorrow.**. It also breaks the trend of the characters â€“ there is a hyphen in the middle above ivory, for the YouTube link, but since the secret message has been finished there are instead more other characters.

The text reads:

> <seead://hhh.awlypextypnclqe.nzx/aczupne/1-7483223/>

If you caesar shit the letters by -11, you get <https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/0-6372112/>. (Note: the numbers must be treated seperately from the letters, and 9 must be wrapped to 0.)

The account, [**xx_SkeletonSquid_xx**](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/xx_skeletonsquid_xx/), was created today, and cannot be found elsewhere.

**TODO**: Verify this

The name of the map is "0" (Minecraft Map), and is tagged as *Other* and an *Air Structure*. The description is:

> I realy [sic] don't know what to s [sic] type here theyu \[sic\] say i need to get 150 charactersa \[sic\] to be apble \[sic\] to post my pa!?!?!? \[sic\] my map\*!?!?!?! lmao... um so yeah i love suiq \[sic\] suid \[sic\]  i mean i mean squids, sory for typoes \[sic\] im 4

Note: "\[sic\]" indicates that this typo was present in the original source.

The typos are as follows (credit to Emma):

| Typo        | Correction     |
|-------------|----------------|
| realy       | really         |
| s           | \[extra letter\] |
| theyu       | they           |
| charactersa | characters     |
| aqble       | able           |
| pa          | map            |
| suiq        | squid          |
| suid        | squid          |
| sory        | sorry          |
| typoes      | typos          |

PMC links to a Mediafire folder called **Camera** but as of 09/08/2024 @21:31BST it is still empty.

@06:57:16BST on 10/08/2024 a file called `0.zip` was uploaded. It contains a Minecraft 1.11 world. Opening it spawns you on an island with a chest that is signed by `ivorycello`. Looking at player data also shows `d0e628d4-40b6-4582-a1d5-4043c7dc6b48` (Ivory's UUID) as having played, which confirms we are on the right track.

**TODO**: what are the contents of her inventory? What other statistics does she have?

The contents of the book are as follows:

> hey! hey uh, are you hurt?  
> ...  
> hello? are you alive?  
> ...  
> oh my gosh...  
> \*groan\*  
> h-hey! you're alive! what happened? are you hurt?  
> \*shriek\*  
> woah- hey, it's ok, i'm here to help-  
> w-who are you?  
> i'm here to help, here, stand up, let me see you. does anything hurt? you look pretty beat-OH  
> ...  
> i'm sorry dear, here, you can take my jacket, cover up with that. you must be freezing...  
> t-thank you  
> um, what hurts? it looks like you've taken a beating...  
> uh... i don't know  
> can you walk?  
> yes.  
> okay okay, here, come with me, my house is just down the road a bit  
> ok  
> you can warm up there, and i'll uh, i'll call the doctor. you can rest for a while.  
> uhm  
> there, there you go. we can go slowly if you need. let's get you out of this weather. how long have you been out here?  
> ...i don't know  
> you don't know?  
> no... i'm sorry  
> no, thats alright don't worry. uhm, lets just get you warmed up. we'll be there in just a few minutes.  
> ...  
> ...  
> ...thank you, s-sir

There is also another book you can find if dropping down into the void in a chest (which is the only other chest according to **NBTExplorer**) at *8 0 7* containing `         s`. Not sure of its importance.
