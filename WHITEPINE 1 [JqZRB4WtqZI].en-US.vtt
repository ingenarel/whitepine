00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:20.720

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.949
ivory:

00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:28.186
clownpierce:
alright, so the owners of this house are all the hemlocke family

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:31.089
clownpierce:
are you willing to care for them and prioritize their every need

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.810
clownpierce:
as a maid of this household?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.868
ivory:
yes sir

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:38.000
clownpierce:
thank you, you can step outside now and wait in the foyer for now

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.095
[muffled] minutetech:
just so you know she may have a bit of trouble learning things around here

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:46.084
[muffled] minutetech:
i told her to read a book just on the train

00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:49.323
[muffled] minutetech:
and she took that as staying up all night to finish the whole thing

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:54.705
[muffled] minutetech:
maybe use a bit of care with your explanations, or she might take them too literally

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:58.654
[muffled] clownpierce:
minute- i thought i was receiving a normal, disciplined worker

00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:01.651
[muffled] minutetech:
oh no she's disciplined and seems to be a very hard worker...

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:05.829
[muffled] minutetech:
i just fear she may have had something in her past or something that made her a bit stunted...

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.099
[muffled] minutetech:
not working wise

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.192
[muffled] clownpierce:
well i wasn't prepared for this, why didn't you say that before?

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:13.594
[muffled] clownpierce:
i need people who can follow orders, and not be overly needy

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:15.767
[muffled] minutetech:
i wouldn't worry, i actually think she'll be perfect

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:19.531
[muffled] minutetech:
and if she has a hard time understanding at first, you can whip her into shape i'm sure

00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:21.635
[muffled] minutetech:
she really needs something stable, y'know?

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:23.440
[muffled] minutetech:
you aren't going to throw her out are you...?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.082
[muffled] clownpierce:
calm down. the hemlockes are already expecting her i wouldn't do anything now

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.355
[muffled] clownpierce:

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.348
clownpierce:
the washboards are for the servants, do not mix them up

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:50.205
clownpierce:

00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:23.865
clownpierce:

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.906
serapter:
o-okay, i don't know how to train people though

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:30.268
clownpierce:

00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:46.608
serapter:
it's like its his job to be like that...

00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:47.512
ivory:
i-i don't mind

00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:49.257
serapter:
and- i'm not even really sure what to train you on...

00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:53.121
serapter:
i mostly just clean and... help the kitchen staff in the mornings

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.442
serapter:
man i am not qualified for this

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:57.091
ivory:
i won't get in the way

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:02.922
serapter:
so... i'm just in charge of like, usually just dusting everything

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:05.670
serapter:
and making everything look neat before the hemlockes wake up

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.101
ivory:
uh- when does the family usually wake up?

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:13.473
serapter:
well, i'd say around 10 or 11. y'know, so, we have plenty of time usually

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.426
ivory:
understood

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:19.349
serapter:
um, i-i guess i'll show you how we dust... it's nothing fancy honestly

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.083
serapter:
if clown was here he'd want you to use like, a damp cloth with like,

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:25.926
serapter:
soap or something afterwards i don't know... uhh that's too much honestly

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:29.750
serapter:
y'know you only really need a duster, really, like, it's called dusting

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.640
serapter:
